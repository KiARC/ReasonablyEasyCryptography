Welcome to **Reasonably Easy Cryptography**, a library designed to do most of the setup for you. Although configuration
is great, sometimes what you need is a library that just works right out of the box. That's why this one exists. The
goal of this project is to create a library that enables anyone to perform encryption and cryptography with minimal work
or understanding of the underlying principals.

## Importing into a project

Download the latest release from the releases page and add it to your dependencies in your IDE.

## Examples

Numerous examples can be found in [the "examples" directory](examples/) detailing the usage of this library. The files
named "SimplestWay" are meant to illustrate the easiest way to use a subset of the library, such as AES or RSA
encryption.

## Configuration

Although the intent of this project is to minimize configuration, there are optional parameters to most methods to allow
overriding the default settings. They're somewhat self-explanatory so for those who really need them, they're there. If
you don't know what one of them means, you probably don't need to change it.
