# Reasonably Easy Cryptography

### *Tired of libraries with great features but a huge amount of setup? This is the repo for you.*

Welcome to **Reasonably Easy Cryptography**, a library designed to do most of the setup for you. Although configuration
is great, sometimes what you need is a library that just works. That's why this one exists. The goal of this project is
to create a library that enables anyone to perform encryption and cryptography with minimal work or understanding of the
underlying principals.
